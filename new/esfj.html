      	<p>As an ESFJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to 
how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system. Your secondary mode is 
internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.</p> 
<p>ESFJ's are people persons - they love people. They are warmly interested in others. They use their Sensing 
and Judging characteristics to gather specific, detailed information about others, and turn this information 
into supportive judgments. They want to like people, and have a special skill at bringing out the best in 
others. They are extremely good at reading others, and understanding their point of view. The ESFJ's strong 
desire to be liked and for everything to be pleasant makes them highly supportive of others. People like to 
be around ESFJ’s, because the ESFJ has a special gift of invariably making people feel good about 
themselves.</p> 
<p>The ESFJ takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very dependable. They value security and 
stability, and have a strong focus on the details of life. They see before others do what needs to be done, 
and do whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done. They enjoy these types of tasks, and are extremely 
good at them.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s are warm and energetic. They need approval from others to feel good about themselves. They are 
hurt by indifference and don't understand unkindness. They are very giving people, who get a lot of their 
personal satisfaction from the happiness of others. They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what 
they give. They're very sensitive to others, and freely give practical care. ESFJ’s are such caring individuals 
that they sometimes have a hard time seeing or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about. 
With Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJ’s are focused on reading other people. They 
have a strong need to be liked, and to be in control. They are extremely good at reading others, and often 
change their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment.</p> 
<p>The ESFJ's value system is defined externally. They usually have very well-formed ideas about the way 
things should be, and are not shy about expressing these opinions. However, they weigh their values and 
morals against the world around them, rather than against an internal value system. They may have a strong 
moral code, but it is defined by the community that they live in, rather than by any strongly felt internal 
values.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong value system that is ethical and 
centered around genuine goodness will most likely be the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly 
give you the shirt off of their back without a second thought. For these individuals, the selfless quality of 
their personality type is genuine and pure. ESFJ’s who have not had the advantage of developing their own 
values by weighing them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values. In 
such cases, the ESFJ most often genuinely believes in the integrity of their skewed value system. They have 
no internal understanding of values to set them straight. In weighing their values against our society, they 
find plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify. This type of ESFJ is a 
dangerous person indeed. Extraverted Feeling drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of 
Intuition prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually quite popular and good with people, 
and good at manipulating them. Unlike their ENFJ cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them 
understand the real consequences of their actions. They are driven to manipulate other to achieve their own 
ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct.All ESFJ’s have a natural tendency to want to control their environment. Their dominant function demands 
structure and organization, and seeks closure. ESFJ’s are most comfortable with structured environments.</p> 
<p>They're not likely to enjoy having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or impersonal 
analysis. They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are very good at tasks which require these kinds 
of skills. ESFJ’s should be careful about controlling people in their lives who do not wish to be controlled. 
ESFJ’s respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe that others should do so as well. 
They're traditional, and prefer to do things in the established way, rather than venturing into uncharted 
territory. Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of the 
established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes blindly accept rules without questioning 
or understanding them. </p>
<p>An ESFJ who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to being quite insecure, and focus all of 
their attention on pleasing others. He or she might also be very controlling, or overly sensitive, imagining 
bad intentions when there weren't any.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our society. However, male ESFJ’s 
will usually not appear feminine at all. On the contrary, ESFJ’s are typically quite conscious about gender 
roles and will be most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in our society. Male ESFJ’s will be 
quite masculine (albeit sensitive when you get to know them), and female ESFJ’s will be very feminine.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful, down-to-earth, practical, thorough, 
consistent, organized, enthusiastic, and energetic. They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable 
lives that are rich in contact with friends and family. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>The ESFJ is called the “caregiver”, and for good reason. Caring is the very nature of their personality; a 
personality driven by feeling judgments and supported by a strong sense of the world around them. The 
ESFJ not only sees how situations affect themselves and others, they are concerned about it. Everything 
that makes them feel valued and successful is bound inextricably to the value and concern they need to 
exchange with others. “Give and ye shall receive” is the motto of the ESFJ, whose gifts serve the most 
important function in all communal human processes, from the family to the wider world of care giving 
such as hospitality, primary teaching, nursing, aged care, social services, human resources and so on. 
Whilst their judgments might be bound by a somewhat conventional moral code, the ESFJ always stands up 
for what they are certain is the best for others. In some situations this trait can lead them into disaster, 
particularly if they are thrust into an unsuitable role. The ESFJ thrives best where they can make the 
decisions and organize things to suit their own way of seeing the world. Regardless however of their 
particular station in life, the ESFJ is at their best when it involves caring for and about others, measuring 
their success by the happiness and gratitude which is reflected back to them from the people in whose lives 
they play a part. </p>

       <p>As an ESFJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other 
types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more 
readily see your place in the world, and how you can better use your talents to achieve your dreams. 
Nearly all ESFJ’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and 
nourish these strengths: </p>
<ul>
<li>A strong sense of what is right and wrong </li>
<li>Easily empathizes with another person </li>
<li>Able to share feelings with other people</li> 
<li>Cares greatly about the welfare of others </li>
<li>Open, honest and forthright about the way they see things</li>
<li>Sensitive to the needs of others, particularly those judged to be less fortunate. </li>
<li>Strongly upholds traditional and safe ways of living </li>
</ul>
<p>ESFJ’s who have a strongly expressed Introverted Sensing function will find they also enjoy these very 
special gifts:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Very sensitive to how any situation might be inwardly affecting another person</li> 
<li>Able to see the potential in any human environment for enabling the comfort and safety of others</li> 
<li>A flair for dramatic illustration and story telling which makes them excellent teachers of the young</li> 
<li>Able to make strong, people oriented administrative decisions</li> 
<li>A skill with fashion and decoration which makes people feel good about themselves</li>

      <div class="panel-body">
     <p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. The strong expression of any function can 
overshadow others, whilst at the same time its own associated and unexpressed inferior function can mine 
the unconscious mind and throw up annoying resistances and unsettling emotions. We value our strengths, 
but we often curse and - even more limiting to our potential development - ignore our weaknesses. To grow 
as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face 
our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential 
problem areas.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s are kind, steady and responsible beings with many special gifts. I would like the ESFJ to keep in 
mind their many positive traits as they read on, and remember that the weaknesses associated with being an 
ESFJ are natural to your type. Although it can be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please 
remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own 
potential, and to live happy and successful lives.</p> 
<p>Many of the ESFJ’s weaker characteristics arise because their dominant and Extraverted Feeling function 
can overshadow the rest of their personality. This generally results in two notable effects. With their 
Introverted Sensing function unable to provide sufficient balance to their sharply defined feeling 
judgments, they often miss the relativities and contingencies of the real world. This very often leads them 
into conflict with those who believe a situation needs to be properly analyzed before its realities can be 
seen and acted upon. Secondly, with their sense of the world controlled by feelings alone, the narrowly 
defined ESFJ will nearly always find themselves at odds with any view of the world that does not see their 
own clearly held judgments to be primary, or which does not accord them the “feeling toned” responses 
they expect. This can produce a range of effects, every one of which ends in conflict for the ESFJ, either 
with others or with their own feelings.</p> 
<p>Without a sound appreciation of the concrete world, an ESFJ may show some or all of the following 
weaknesses in varying degrees:</p>
<ul> 
<li>May be unable to correctly judge what really is for the best</li> 
<li>May become spiteful and extremely intractable in the face of clear logical reasoning.</li>  
<li>May be unable to shrug off feelings that others are not “good people”. </li> 
<li>May be unable to acknowledge anything that goes against their certainty about the “correct” or 
“right” way to do things </li> 
<li>May attribute their own problems to arbitrary and improvable notions about the way people 
“ought” to behave.</li>  
<li>May be at a loss when confronted with situations that require basic technical expertise or clear 
thinking. </li> 
<li>May be oblivious to all but their own viewpoint, valuing their own certainties to the exclusion of 
others. </li> 
<li>May be unable to understand verbal logic, and quickly cut off other’s explanations </li> 
<li>May be falsely certain of the true needs and feelings of others. </li> 
<li>May be extremely vulnerable to superstitions, religious cults and media manipulation.</li> 
<li>May react too quickly and too emotionally in a situation better dealt with in a more pragmatic 
fashion.</li>

        <p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the 
ESFJ’s externally mapped, feeling based view of the world not being successfully coupled to an 
appropriate level of Introverted Sensation. Without this internal balance, the ESFJ’s perceptions and ideas 
are determined by feeling judgments which are not in always a valid basis for understanding.</p> 
<p>ESFJ’s are usually stable, certain, reliable and caring in their approach to life, but if unbalanced they are 
likely to treat any point of view other than their own with a kind of amused indifference or a tendency to 
keep those with differing attitudes and opinions at a distance. Whilst this is natural survival behavior for the 
strongly expressed ESFJ personality, if they do not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing 
viewpoints they come into contact with, ESFJ’s can find themselves waging a self created war against all 
that opposes their own. This conflict often expresses itself in various unambiguous and simplistic “Us 
verses Them” generalities, or a penchant for smugly and narrowly defining other people by arbitrary or 
superstitious belief systems, which often actually symbolize and define their own conflict. At its worst, this 
conflict with the obstinate and unfeeling contingent realities of the world creates a situation where the ESFJ 
retreats to a kind of psychological castle where, not only none but those who have the “right” or “nice” 
approach can enter, but also where the ESFJ’s feeling based and often tortured logic, attitudes and 
judgments reign supreme and cannot be questioned; a place where: “give and you shall receive” can 
ironically twist quickly into: “off with his head!”</p> 
<p>The main driver to the ESFJ personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose function is to judge the relative 
human value of the ideas, behaviors, situations and objects they perceive. The resulting world view is tidy, 
and ordered according to its worth to the ESFJ’s own particular character: “Everything has its place and 
everything in its place”. If this picture of the world is threatened by external influences, the ESFJ generally 
tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the 
individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly 
will find they can only connect and relate with those who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow 
and rigid world view. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will 
always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for 
them to maintain the flexibility needed for a healthy relationship with the messy world outside because the 
differing ways others value things is a constant affront to their personal judgments.</p> 
<p>It is not an uncommon tendency for the ESFJ to support their feeling judgments by selectively using only 
their immediate perceptions of a situation and how it appears to them. However, if this tendency is given 
free reign, the resulting ESFJ personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. The ESFJ's 
auxiliary function of Introverted Sensing must be allowed to grow beyond this limit, where it is used only 
to support Extraverted Feeling judgments. If the ESFJ uses Introverted Sensing only to serve this purpose, 
then the ESFJ is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the ESFJ does not sufficiently 
recognize and understand the vast number of contingent and differing ways in which the world is perceived 
by others. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in 
order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat illogical and full of 
fixed and often rather staid or conventional ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the 
simplicity, ambiguity and often unrelenting vehemence of their ideas.</p>

      <p>To grow as an individual, the ESFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate 
picture of the world and its ways. In order to be in a position in which the ESFJ is able to perceive and 
consider data that is foreign to their value system, the ESFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not 
threatened by the new information. The ESFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that the judgments of 
others are not unrelated to reality; that the ideas of others are also just and valid within a wider and less 
rigorous vision of the world.The ESFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the way things appear to them. 
Do they try to find the basic connections between the elements of a situation? Or, do they appreciate only 
those elements which accord them a feeling of worth? At the moment when some connection or 
relationship between things is perceived, is the ESFJ only concerned with whether that perception supports 
something they value? Or is she/he concerned with becoming truly appraised of how things fit together in 
the world? To achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the ESFJ should 
try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognize how others see things, before making 
judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with 
their carefully adjudicated system of relative worth, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should 
try to see the way others might see situations, without making personal judgments about how others ought 
to feel. In general, they should work on exercising their Sensation in a truly introverted sense. In other 
words, they should use Sensation to recognize that all parts of a situation are necessary for its functionality 
and that valuing one function or objective connection over another narrows their ability to deal with the real 
world as it truly is. The ESFJ who can successfully envision the world as a realm of functioning and 
connected parts which are all necessary to its balance can be quite a powerful force for positive change. </p>
<u>Living Happily in our World as an ESFJ </u>
<p>Some ESFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an inability 
understand the connections and relationships necessary to each situation, a too conventional and dogmatic 
set of values which limits the way others can relate to them, or an unrealistic and illogical view of the 
world. These issues mostly stem from using Introverted Sensation in a diminished manner: the lack of a 
strong internally focused viewpoint allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended set of values to 
control the personality. An ESFJ who attempts to envision a more accurate and impartial view of the world 
for the sake of understanding the ways of others, rather than quickly deciding how things alone affect them, 
will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon adherence to 
values and care for others, but also how the world relies upon structure and laws which function regardless 
of their human value. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and 
the behavior of others conform to values of right and wrong, good and bad, worthy and worthless etc. Such 
well-adjusted ESFJ’s will fit happily into our society.</p> 
<p>Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a 
difficult task to suddenly start to use Sensation in an unambiguous and totally introverted direction. It's 
difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. With 
that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your 
Introverted Sensation more fully:</p> 
<p>Take care to try and discover how others see things. Try to notice the connections they make between ideas 
and objects. Don’t immediately compare your own vision of things to theirs; simply accept that for them 
the world fits together in a valid way.</p> 
<p>Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or disregarded by others. Now 
try to understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't try to assume they would 
judge as you do: "she would have to feel the same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his 
tune if he saw things from my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the 
situation. Would they analyze it through a code of values, or see it as an opportunity to grasp a wider 
perspective in which a solution can be found? Would it affect them personally or would they view it 
impartially? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own. 
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to finding out how 
the other person sees the world around them. Concentrate on really sensing the relationships within what 
they describe. Tell them how you see the world and compare. Ask questions about why things seem so to 
them.</p> 
<p>Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their 
own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember 
that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize whatthat person is seeing right now. What connections are they making or enacting, what thoughts are they 
having? Don't pass judgment, or compare their situation to your own.</p> 
<p>Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.</p>

<li>Feed Your Strengths! Let your talent for caring and giving spill out into the world around you, 
show your gifts to the world. Allow yourself to take opportunities to nurture and develop 
situations in your home and work environments which bring value for yourself and others. Find 
work or a hobby which allows you to realize these strengths.</li> 
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some things are never going to be how you would 
like them to be. Understand that other peoples need to deal with the world regardless of how it 
seems. Facing and dealing with discord or differences in others doesn't mean that you have to 
change who you are; it means that you are giving yourself opportunities to grow. By facing your 
weaknesses, you honor your true self and that of others.</li> 
<li>Discover the World of Others. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you always know 
what is right for others. Open your heart to the possibility of understanding that their true needs 
are something that must be discovered through recognition that their view of the world might be 
very different, yet just as valid as your own.</li> 
<li>Don’t be too hasty. Try to let things settle before you make a judgment, allowing others to 
discover the best for themselves while you try to see all the variables and contingencies in a 
situation.</li> 
<li>Look Carefully at the World. Remember, things are not always what they seem on the surface. 
You might need to look deeper to discover the truth, particularly when it seems you are sure of 
your first quick judgment. There are layers of meaning and truth beneath everything.</li> 
<li>Try to Let Others Take Some of the Load. By letting others make their own judgments, you are 
not letting things get out of control, but are validating their own need to be a part of your life. 
Remember, it is better to guide another to see your point of view than keeping them out of the 
picture. </li>
<li>Be Accountable to Others. Remember that they need to understand you and your needs too. 
Express your doubts and difficulties as well as your reasons and let them become partners to your 
goals.</li> 
<li>Don’t Hem Yourself in. Staying in your comfort zone is self defeating in the end. Try to make 
every day one where you get out and discover a little something different about the world and 
others. This will broaden your horizons and bring new ideas and opportunities into focus.</li> 
<li>Assume the Best and Seek for it. Don't wait for others to live up to your expectations. Every 
person has a goldmine of worth in them, just as every situation can be turned to some good. If you 
let yourself believe this, you will find yourself discovering ways to make it true for you.</li> 
<li>When in Doubt, Ask For Help! Don't let your fears leave you on the horns of a dilemma or lead 
you into disaster. If you are uncertain of something or someone then get input from others who 
have greater experience in dealing with this difficulty.</li>
