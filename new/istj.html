       <p>As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in

<p>ISTJ's are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful

<p>ISTJ’s tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're 
not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If they are able to see a

      	<p>As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in 
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where 
you deal with things rationally and logically.</p> 
<p>ISTJ's are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful 
living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends them a serious air 
and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and methodical in their 
approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they undertake.</p> 
<p>ISTJ’s are very loyal, faithful, and dependable. They place great importance on honesty 
and integrity. They are "good citizens" who can be depended on to do the right thing for 
their families and communities. While they generally take things very seriously, they also 
usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or 
work-related gatherings.</p> 
<p>ISTJ’s tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're 
not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If they are able to see a 
good reason for stepping outside of the established mode of doing things, the ISTJ will 
support that effort. However, ISTJ’s more often tend to believe that things should be done 
according to procedures and plans. If an ISTJ has not developed their Intuitive side 
sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing 
everything "by the book".</p> 
<p>The ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has 
promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them. 
Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a difficult time saying 
"no" when they are given more work than they can reasonably handle. For this reason, the 
ISTJ often works long hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of.</p> 
<p>The ISTJ will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into 
doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they will resist 
putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a 
practical application. They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the 
situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in 
positions of authority. The ISTJ has little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the 
practical application is clear.</p> 
<p>ISTJ’s have tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts within 
themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing preference. They may havedifficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from their own perspective. 
However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea to someone who they 
respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact, which the ISTJ will internalize and 
support. Once the ISTJ supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to 
ensure that they are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed. 
The ISTJ is not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of others. They 
may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as they are presented. 
Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for 
granted, like they take their own efforts for granted. They need to remember to pat people 
on the back once in a while. </p>
<p>ISTJ’s are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others. 
However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any 
situation usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they are usually 
quite supporting and caring individuals with the people that they love. Once the ISTJ 
realizes the emotional needs of those who are close to them, they put forth effort to meet 
those needs.</p> 
<p>The ISTJ is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they will put 
forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families running smoothly. They 
are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles seriously. They are usually good and 
generous providers to their families. They care deeply about those close to them, 
although they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love. The ISTJ is likely to 
express their affection through actions, rather than through words.</p> 
<p>ISTJ’s have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and 
implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who do not allow 
obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not usually give 
themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as 
the natural fulfillment of their obligations.</p> 
<p>ISTJ’s usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic appreciation. Their 
homes are likely to be tastefully furnished and immaculately maintained. They are 
acutely aware of their senses, and want to be in surroundings which fit their need for 
structure, order, and beauty.</p> 
<p>Under stress, ISTJ’s may fall into "catastrophe mode", where they see nothing but all of 
the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for things which 
they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose 
their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with their 
visions of doom.</p> 
<p>In general, the ISTJ has a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical, reasonable, 
and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peacefulliving, the ISTJ has what it takes to be highly effective at achieving their chosen goals - 
whatever they may be.</p>

<p>ISTJ’s have one character trait which puts them at a definite advantage in terms of career 
success - Perseverance. An ISTJ can do almost anything that they have decided to do. 
However, there are areas in which they will function more happily and naturally. An ISTJ 
will do best in a career in which they can use their excellent organizational skills and 
their powers of concentration to create order and structure. ISTJ’s seem to fit extremely 
well into the Management and Executive layer of the corporate business world. </p>

       <p>The ISTJ's word is as good as gold, and they honor their commitments faithfully. They 
believe that to do otherwise would be nothing less than a breach of honor and 
trustworthiness. Consequently, they take their vows very seriously, and once they have 
said "I do", that means they are bound to the relationship until "death do us apart" orotherwise. ISTJ’s are driven to fulfill their responsibilities and duties, and will do so with 
tireless effort. They will do their best to meet the obligations presented by the different 
relationship roles which they play during their lives, i.e. spouse, parent, offspring, etc. 
They may have difficulty showing warmth, but they frequently feel it in abundance, and 
most develop the ability to show it through sheer effort. If nothing else, the ISTJ holds 
the gold medal of all the personality types for Effort. They will put forth tremendous 
amounts of effort to accomplish goals which are important to them. If healthy 
relationships are among these goals, you can bet that the ISTJ will do everything that they 
can to foster and maintain healthy relationships. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>People with the ISTJ personality type are serious, methodical, analytical, and hard- 
working. They store knowledge gained from their experiences, and use this knowledge to 
tackle new problems and ideas. They will work a problem through to its identified 
conclusion. They work towards defined goals; their analytical objectivity gives them the 
tendency to make goal-oriented decisions that are not waylaid by the concerns of 
individuals. They're uncomfortable with ideas that are completely new to them, or that 
are totally theoretical in nature. Since they have no direct experience with the new 
concept, they have no tools for knowing how to deal with it or what to think about it. 
They need to get the framework for a new concept before they're able to deal with it. An 
experienced ISTJ is usually a very capable person, and makes an excellent manager. </p>
<p>ISTJ’s have great value for the "tried and true" approach, and are reluctant to adopt new 
systems until direct experience proves the validity of the new system. They internalize 
and value the rules and structure of the society in which they live, and disapprove of 
behaviors that go against these rules. ISTJ’s highly value the cornerstone institutions of 
society such as Family, Work, and Church. Their hard-working, dedicated nature is 
especially well-suited for holding up such institutions. An ISTJ's feeling of success 
depends upon being able to use their experience for the benefit of an institution, and alsoupon the level of structure and lack of chaos in their life, and in the health and welfare of 
their family or other social structure. </p>

       <p>As an ISTJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural 
strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth 
and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content 
with your role. </p>
<p>Nearly all ISTJ’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should 
embrace and nourish these strengths: </p>
<ul>
<li>Their desire to execute known systems against concrete facts makes them happy 
to chunk through large amounts of routine work.</li> 
<li>With their respect for rules and order, they value honesty and integrity and seek to 
live with these ideals. </li> 
<li>An ISTJ has a "stick to it" attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put 
forth a great deal of effort towards something that they are interested in. This 
persistence will help the ISTJ to achieve any identified goal.</li>  
<li>The ISTJ's value for social structure makes them more interested in being social 
than is true for many Introverts. </li>
</ul> 
<p>ISTJ’s who have developed their Extraverted Thinking will complement their interest in 
their inner world of concrete data with an interest in the welfare of the rest of the world, 
especially with regards to upholding social systems and traditions. These ISTJ’s enjoy 
these very special gifts: </p>
<ul>
<li>They will move beyond an expectation that others should follow rules into a 
dedication and willingness to work hard to uphold standards themselves. </li> 
<li>They show a dedication to maintaining personal relationships that lends them a 
respect for individual differences. </li> 
<li>They will use their inner store of facts for the benefit of an institution or society in 
general, rather than to satisfy their own interests. </li> 
<li>The more they develop their Extraverted Thinking, the better they will become at 
strategizing. They will be able to brainstorm multiple possible solutions to 
problems. </li> 
<li>ISTJ’s are often uncomfortable with decisions based on values rather than on 
objective criteria, but the more they develop their Extraverted Thinking, the more 
likely they will become able to use Introverted Feeling as a positive force rather 
than strictly a negative one. This will allow them to understand a value judgment 
that is based on personal perspective rather than social obligation. </li>

     	<p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be 
no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we 
often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of 
life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses anddeal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem 
areas.</p> 
<p>Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in ISTJ’s are due to their dominant 
Introverted Sensing function controlling the personality to the point that all other 
functions are being used to defend Sensing demands, rather than for their more balanced 
purposes. In such cases, an ISTJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in 
varying degrees:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Excessive love of food and drink </li>
<li>Lack of interest in other people, or in relating to them</li> 
<li>Occasional inappropriate emotional displays </li>
<li>General selfish "look after oneself" tendencies </li>
<li>Uses judgment to dismiss other's opinions and perspectives, before really 
understanding them </li>
<li>May judge others rather than themselves</li> 
<li>May look at external ideas and people with the primary purpose of finding fault </li>
<li>May become slave to their routine and "by the book" ways of doing things, to the 
point that any deviation is completely unacceptable</li> 
<li>May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to anyone </li>
<li>Explanation of Problems </li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various 
degrees to the common ISTJ problem of Introverted Sensing overtaking the ISTJ's 
personality to the point that all other functions become slaves to Introverted Sensing. A 
more "whole" personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and 
auxiliary functions. For an ISTJ, the dominant Introverted Sensing needs to be well- 
supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists 
only to support the desires of Introverted Sensing, than neither function is being used to 
its potential.</p>
<p>Introverted Sensing is a personality function that constantly gathers data and stores it in a 
sort of informational database to be accessed at will in the future. As the dominant player 
in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with facts to store. 
As something new is perceived, it is added to the vast warehouse of Introverted Sensing 
data. Introverted Sensing does not in itself analyze this data for meaning or connection--it 
just takes it in as information. In order to sort through and make use of this information, a 
judging function must be applied. It is the judging function that does the analysis and 
ordering of the data.</p> 
<p>When Introverted Sensing is too dominant, or Extraverted Thinking is not developed 
sufficiently, we see the ISTJ using Extraverted Thinking to order the individual's world in 
such a way that Introverted Sensing can reign without interference. This may include 
dismissing the importance of relationships, or pushing away anything that threatens the 
ISTJ's highly introverted way of life. In this manner, Extraverted Thinking is used against 
the external world, rather than against the ISTJ's internal data. It is a defensive shield, 
rather than a useful filter.The better, more "whole" use of Extraverted Thinking for the ISTJ would be to use it to 
order and evaluate its own rich store of data, and therefore generate useful solutions to 
problems and efficient systems. Like all types, most ISTJ’s will show some signs of this 
kind of weakness. This does not mean that they're hopelessly flawed. The real problems 
occur when an ISTJ personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely 
selfish and unable to consider the importance or validity of anyone else's perspective. </p>

        <p>To grow as an individual, the ISTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment against 
information that they have gathered, rather than against single facts or ideas coming from 
others. Before judging, put all new data into the context of existing facts. Working with 
all of the facts at your disposal will greatly improve your ability to judge effectively, and 
will reduce the likelihood that you will become offensively reactionary and isolationist.</p> 
<p>An ISTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of 
there judgments, and their motivations for making judgments. Are they judging 
something external to themselves, or are they judging something within the context of 
their stored knowledge? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand 
its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an ISTJ will judge something 
without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to 
understand, then to judge.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
      <p>People of all personality types sometimes experience problems dealing with specific 
aspects of civilization and human interaction. For the ISTJ, problems are generally 
associated with being unable to tolerate behaviors that go outside perceived norms, and 
with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These problems stem from 
building up the importance of the ISTJ's inner world and diminishing the importance of 
the external world. ISTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and experience can be 
enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and experience will find that they 
can be committed to their internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with 
others. The key to accomplishing this is development of their highest extraverted 
function, Extraverted Thinking.</p> 
<p>An ISTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally may 
become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations of 
others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others 
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others. 
This will preserve the sanctity of the ISTJ's inner world and lifestyle, but will reduce a lot 
of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the 
development of the ISTJ's rich store of experiential data. In extreme cases the ISTJ may 
find him or herself quite alone and lonely.</p> 
<p>More commonly, the ISTJ will run into trouble when they try to order and structure the 
outer world, rather than their inner world. Trying to structure people into a predefined,acceptable system is problematic. The personality types who value the unique individual 
will be offended by the apparent lack of respect for their person, and people with 
personality types who follow social values will want to be honoring their own system, 
rather then being forced to follow yours. Many people experience being controlled or 
manipulated as a form of suppression, and resist it. Eventually, they may harbor serious 
resentment against the suppressor. </p>

Try to identify the personality type of everyone you encounter frequently in your life. 
Remember that Intuitives often have a wandering style of expression. Try to exhibit 
tolerance for this.</p> 
<p>Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. 
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with 
whom you are speaking.</p>

<li>Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your excellent organizational and 
logical abilities to flourish. Explore the worlds of business management, 
accounting, and medicine. </li>
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to 
overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal store 
of knowledge, rather than as a means of disregarding other people's ideas.</li> 
<li>Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your vast amount of 
information in order to put things into perspective. Give yourself appropriate time 
to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. Some find that 
externalizing your thoughts is a valuable exercise, as is expressing your ideas 
clearly in writing. </li>
<li>Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the 
person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After 
all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. As Steven 
Covey says, "Seek first to understand, and then to be understood."</li> 
<li>Quench Your Desire to Control Others. Remember that most people do not want 
to be controlled. Again, turn your controlling tendencies inwardly rather than 
outwardly. You can only really control yourself. </li>
<li>Be Aware of Others. Take time to notice where others are coming from. What is 
their personality type? How are they currently feeling?</li> 
<li>Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other 
people. Look inwardly for solutions. </li>
<li>Be Gentle in Your Expectations, and judge yourself at least as harshly as you 
judge others.</li>
<li>Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side 
of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is 
a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by 
positive attitudes, and vice versa. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.</li> 
<li>There is Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself. Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk to 
initiate change. Don't be afraid to do so when that time comes. In most cases, the 
obstacles and burdens standing in the way of your goal are not really there--they 
just exist in your perspective. Change your perspective--change your life. </li>
