      <p> As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via
your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.
With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is
understanding the world that they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the
situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually
extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP

This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their
lives. They generally understand things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible
and adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very aware of possibilities, and this
makes them quite resourceful when solving problems.
ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get

      	<p>As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via 
your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically. 
With Extroverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is 
understanding the world that they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the 
situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually 
extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP 
cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types. </p>
<p>This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their 
lives. They generally understand things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible 
and adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow 
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very aware of possibilities, and this 
makes them quite resourceful when solving problems.</p> 
<p>ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get 
excited and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, 
they get the support that they need to fulfill their visions. </p>
<p>ENTP’s are less interested in developing plans of actions or making decisions than they are in generating 
possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore to the ENTP. 
For some ENTP’s, this results in the habit of never finishing what they start. The ENTP who has not 
developed their Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically from idea to idea, 
without following through on their plans. The ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in 
order to take advantage of them.</p> 
<p>The ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking drives their decision making process. Although the 
ENTP is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions, they are quite rational and 
logical in reaching conclusions. When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can 
be very powerful indeed. A well-developed ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising. 
ENTP’s are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring with others. They love to 
debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes just for the love of the debate. When they express their 
underlying principles, however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.</p>
<p>The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type. The ENTP "lawyer" quickly and 
accurately understands a situation, and objectively and logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking 
side makes their actions and decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the ENTP was 
defending someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of quirks in the 
law that will get their client off the hook. If they were to actually win the case, they would see their actions 
as completely fair and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful. The guilt or innocence of 
their client would not be as relevant. If this type of reasoning goes incompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it 
could result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The ENTP, who does 
not naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision making, should take care to notice 
the subjective, personal side of situations. This is a potential problem are for ENTP’s. Although their 
logical abilities lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from their feelings and 
from other people.The least developed area for the ENTP is the Sensing-Feeling arena. If the Sensing areas are neglected, the 
ENTP may tend to not take care of details in their life. If their Feeling part is neglected, the ENTP may not 
value other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive. </p>
<p>Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities, and become obsessed with minor 
details. These details may seem to be extremely important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not 
important to the big picture.</p> 
<p>In general, ENTP’s are upbeat visionaries. They highly value knowledge, and spend much of their lives 
seeking a higher understanding. They live in the world of possibilities, and become excited about concepts, 
challenges and difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come 
up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, curious, and theoretical, ENTP’s have a broad range of 
possibilities in their lives.</p>

 		<p>ENTP personalities are motivated by possibilities. They love the outside chances; the new or unusual 
combinations lurking within the ordinary everyday world of things and ideas. For them, something is 
always on the up, something is always tantalizing their desire to re-orchestrate life into new patterns and 
shapes; new ways of fulfilling what can be as strong as a never ending desire to beat the odds and win at 
every game in town, or as mild as a quirky personal need for constant variety and change. With their 
thinking tied to the myriad possibilities they see in the world, they act swiftly and decisively upon those 
angles, choices and combinations scarcely noticed by other types, but through which they can build whole 
new frameworks or completely redefine an existing external situation in such a way that it appears new, 
revitalized and once again full of promise. Sameness, stasis, conservatism - even daily routine - can be 
loathsome to fervent ENTP’s, whose drive is always to be into something new, different and full of fresh 
possibilities, and who, given the opportunity, will always be the first to show others a new path to success 
in a venture, or to find a way of doing something that no-one has done before.</p> 
<p>ENTP people measure their success by their “aha” moments, by the sense of satisfaction which comes as 
they spread their newly written maps before them and contemplate the new adventure, design, investigation 
or conquest which has now become their road ahead. What has gone before, previous achievements, ways 
of living - even people met along the way - are often now forgotten or considered passé, mere steps along a 
path which has now brought a new frontier to be exploited for its gifts. Whether it is the search for 
knowledge, money, power, fame or pleasure, the ENTP will be found at the frontline, gazing into the 
distance and discovering new avenues toward, bigger, better or more satisfying outcomes.</p> 
<p>ENTP’s are the great problem solvers, discoverers and re-inventors of the world. Their insights into the 
world around them, their ability to see new ways of putting things together and making them work can 
bring them great success in virtually any industry or human pursuit that interests them. For this reason the 
ENTP is happiest in situations where they can use their intuitive powers freely and have the space in which 
to think upon the aspects and angles which come to them. Without fulfilling work and the freedom to use 
their mind most productively, ENTP’s can quickly tire of a limiting situation. For this reason an open road 
toward success is an extremely important factor in the ENTP’s life. Some, given a little opportunity, will 
clear one for themselves, but of all the types, it is the ENTP who has most need to be aware of the life and 
career situations they might commit to without sufficient thought for the future.</p> 
<u>Allowing Your ENTP Strengths to Flourish</u>
<p>As an ENTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other 
types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more 
readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role.</p> 
<p>Nearly all ENTP’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and 
nourish these strengths: </p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to hold many points of view in mind and see their differing merits.</li> 
<li>Seeing ways to do things others have not thought of. </li> 
<li>Able to give quick and diverse answers to any question of interest. </li> 
<li>Seeing the other side of a situation and making it known. </li> 
<li>Being able to juggle many differing jobs or processes at the one time. </li> 
<li>Easily capable of holding your own in any argument or discussion.</li> 
<li>The ability to quickly find the best or most useful side of others.</li> 
<li>Seeing the many connections between events and things which are not immediately obvious to 
others.</li>
</ul> 
<p>ENTP’s who have developed their Introverted Thinking to the extent that they regularly and carefully 
interpret the information their Extroverted Intuition brings to them will enjoy these very special gifts:</p>
<ul> 
<li>The ability to solve puzzles and problems that have no obvious way to resolution. </li>
<li>The ability to define schematically a new structure or design and know it will work. </li>
<li>Knowing and giving to others the very thing they need when they are not sure themselves. </li>
<li>A talent for innovative creation in writing, music or the visual arts. </li>
<li>The gift of knowing which new ideas or changes will enhance rather than detract from their 
relationships with others</li>
</ul>

       <p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good". 
Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our 
weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our 
strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our 
personality type's potential problem areas.</p> 
<p>Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in ENTP’s are due to their dominant function of 
Extroverted Intuition overtaking the personality to the point that the other functions exist merely to serve its 
purposes. In such cases, an ENTP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:</p> 
<ul>
<li>The inability to maintain a comfortable situation or relationship once its possibilities have been 
realized or exhausted.</li> 
<li>A tendency to consider careful or meticulous thinkers as unworthy plodders or time wasters.</li> 
<li>Blindness to the needs and feelings of others not directly involved in the ENTP’s current area of 
interest. </li>
<li>A lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance, security or 
commitment.</li> 
<li>The inability to deal carefully and calmly with the finer details of a situation or work in progress. 
Becoming overly annoyed by minor setbacks or small things that have to be set right before the 
goal can be realized.</li>
<li>A tendency to be arrogant or boastful, or to demean those who cannot see the same answers. 
Can often find themselves in bad situations by too quickly taking a big step forward or by being 
“too smart for their own good”. </li>

    <div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the 
common ENTP problem of being so fascinated with their Extroverted Intuitions that they fail to develop a 
careful thinking process sufficient to balance it. Leaps of perception, new ideas and strange but fascinating 
juxtapositions are wonderful for the potential freshness and possible success they might bring. But if not 
carefully appraised and chosen wisely they can also take us far from the right path in life, take us from our 
friends, spoil our relationships and even bring personal or financial disaster. Without a well developed 
thinking function, the ENTP is always in danger of leaping over social, financial and personal constraints 
for the sake of following a new vision. This might be as simple as arousing the wrath of ones partner by 
suddenly deciding to by an expensive gadget or change something around the house without being 
concerned for their input or feelings, or as complex as allowing an ill considered entrepreneurial idea lead 
them into financial and social disaster, simply because the one sided vision of Extroverted Intuition does 
not recognize or count the amount of small but important details which need to be right before such ideas 
can be realized.</p> 
<p>Without a solid thinking function, the ENTP can easily discount or fail to notice the essential ethics of 
social and interpersonal relationship, often considering themselves “above” or untouched by such limiting values and often discounting the possibility that their actions might be or hurtful or seen as unethical by 
others. It is not that the one sided ENTP is deliberately hurtful, but simply ignorant of the effects which can 
flow from their often compulsive need for change or need to show how clever or individual they are. In the 
ENTP, the lack of a well developed Feeling Function means that they must learn to “understand” feeling in 
both themselves and others and come to terms with its affects. This understanding can only come from 
thinking carefully about the ways feeling affects not only themselves, but others, and the importance others 
place on this function. The ENTP has a feeling function more or less global in character and one which 
does not judge fine differences. This inability to discriminate feelings can allow the ENTP to say and do 
much that leaves others in the cold, so an effort to think about the feeling process can be essential. Without 
the understanding this brings, the ENTP can separate themselves from the ground of their life, from the 
constancy of their friends and family and, without even realizing it, they can easily find themselves in 
untenable positions where, without support, they wonder why they are suddenly alone and lost.</p> 
<p>Another significant problem arises where the ENTP has grown within or is locked by circumstances to an 
environment which limits their freedom or their ability to utilize their specific abilities. This forces the 
ENTP to narrow down their intuitive process to the point where it retains at least some freedom to operate 
within their life. Under such conditions however, the intuition is free only to range over a small and limited 
field of vision, a field which usually consists only of the very things the ENTP is normally unconcerned 
about: the small details of life and its familiar objects. Without the ability to take stock and apply careful 
thought to the ways they might expand their horizons, the ENTP in such situations can become morose, 
niggardly and obsessed with the most minor or intangible details – to the point where such minutiae fill 
their life and each day becomes a frustrating process of eliminating again and again the little problems 
which ever seem to stand in the way of the “big” picture – a picture which, as those around them know only 
too well, will never be realized. </p>

     	<p>To grow as an individual, the ENTP needs to focus on carefully analyzing the information they receive via 
their Extroverted Intuition. They need to allow themselves sufficient time and space to relax with the ideas 
and possibilities they can see. It is all too easy for the ENTP to assume that what they see is what they 
need. Careful thinking can allow the ENTP to figure out the best possible ways to proceed out of all the 
possibilities that come to them. At the same time, even if they are not able to share them, ENTP’s need at 
least to understand the joys and satisfactions that others derive within those situations the ENTP would not 
normally choose in life. Awareness of the ways and needs of others can be the key to understanding the 
most life affirming way ahead for the ENTP, for there is always a danger that they might choose paths 
without regard to the feelings and needs of others close to them. The ENTP learns from analyzing his 
experience, so the best way for the ENTP to grow as a person is to develop his thinking capacity. Thus, that 
while the desire to run out and do something "new" is an ENTP pattern of need, this need must be 
integrated into a whole way of life in which the rest of our human needs and those of others who rely upon 
our presence are also satisfied. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand 
yourself in a truly objective fashion, and how you can best give to the world, rather than just exploit the 
possibilities it bring to you.</p> 
<p>The ENTP should always pay close attention to why they are acting upon new information. Are they acting 
out of a carefully considered motive to realize something truly worthwhile for themselves and others? Are 
they really seeking to improve life, or concerned with just making the next play, proving the point, showing 
others the moves or climbing the mountain just because it is there to climb, regardless of the consequences? </p>

The problems ENTP’s might have fitting into the world are not usually directly related to friends or 
relationships. Rather, the ENTP has trouble maintaining a stable and consistent lifestyle. While this can 
affect love relationships, the ENTP usually has such an endearing and capable “way” about them that 
others tend to follow their lead, even in the most trying of situations. The problems the ENTP generates in 
life are those associated with their constant need for individuality, excellence and new experiences which 
test their talents. While this can place great demand upon relationships, tensions are usually only apparent 
where the ENTP has made a love match with a person whose security needs are greater than their ability to 
allow their ENTP partner the freedom they need. The self aware ENTP must therefore not only be careful in considering their career choices, but also in choosing a life situation with a partner. Of all the types, the 
ENTP is most uncomfortable with compromise and ought not to place themselves in situations which 
demand it. Most importantly the ENTP must become aware, through careful analysis of experience, just 
what kind of changes for the good or bad have been the direct result of their need for constant refreshment 
of life. Only through this awareness will the ENTP be able to focus on those perceptions which promise a 
better and more fruitful life.</p> 
<p>Most ENTP’s will experience career/life frustration and some relationship difficulties through their lives. 
The ENTP with well-developed Introverted Thinking will find these times easier to deal with. Accordingly, 
we offer some general suggestions for dealing with these difficulties, as well as some advice that will help 
the ENTP develop their Introverted Thinking.</p>

      <p>Take time to really listen to the thoughts of others and try to see how they understand the world. Think 
about the ways in which your view of the world and your needs can mesh with theirs.</p> 
<p>Don't expect others to simply follow you or expect that they should see what you can see as a worthy goal. 
A good exercise is to imagine yourself as a blind or severely disabled person. Try to get the feel of what it 
would be like to have to organize your life from such a different perspective. Would your goals still be 
valid? Would they need re-thinking? Consider the possibility that while your way of thinking leads you to 
see other types as having limited vision or ability, the truth is that they are no more limited than yourself, 
but simply have a differing focus in life and differing needs. </p>
<p>Realize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will require you to attend to the small details of life 
and show an awareness of your partner’s feelings. You might find this difficult, but it will pay the biggest 
dividends in return for your effort. </p>
<p>Expanding your appreciation of the differences between people will expand your understanding of human 
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and encounter in your life. 
Take care to listen to what people express within different social and work situations. Notice the different 
ways they go about their dealings with others or solving their problems. Do not try to compare or judge 
their ways against your own, simply try to recognize the many ways it is possible to be at peace in the 
world.</p> 
<p>When having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at least half of the time talking about them. 
Concentrate on really understanding where the person is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions. 
Think of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they have their own passions, satisfactions and 
needs. Try to visualize what that person is doing, and narrow down to how they are feeling at this moment; 
to one thing they might be thinking about. Don't pass judgment, just consider and reflect on why they might 
think or feel in just such a way.</p>

of its stepping stones created to fulfill a different part of the human need for constancy and 
security. Without this support structure, you cannot go far. </li>

comfort zone. If you're feeling uncomfortable in situation because it seems to be going nowhere, 
that's good! That's an opportunity for growth. </li>
<li>Identify and Express Your Feelings You may have a hard time understanding your feelings. It's 
important that you try to figure this out. Don't let people down. If you determine that you value a 
person, tell them so every time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in 
your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship. </li>
<li>Be Accountable for Yourself Remember that no one has more control over your life than you 
have. Don't be a victim. </li>
<li>Assume the Best, But Be Wary. Your positive attitude nearly always creates positive situations. 
Just remember: to make them lasting and worthwhile you must build them on solid, carefully 
planned foundations. </li>
