       <p>As an ISFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in 
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where 
you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your 
personal value system.</p> 
<p>ISFJ's live in a world that is concrete and kind. They are truly warm and kind-hearted, 
and want to believe the best of people. They value harmony and cooperation, and are 
likely to be very sensitive to other people's feelings. People value the ISFJ for their 
consideration and awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in others by their firm 
desire to believe the best.</p> 
<p>ISFJ’s have a rich inner world that is not usually obvious to observers. They constantly 
take in information about people and situations that is personally important to them, and 
store it away. This tremendous store of information is usually startlingly accurate, 
because the ISFJ has an exceptional memory about things that are important to their value 
systems. It would not be uncommon for the ISFJ to remember a particular facial 
expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event occurred, if the situation 
made an impression on the ISFJ.</p> 
<p>ISFJ’s have a very clear idea of the way things should be, which they strive to attain. 
They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. They tend to believe 
that existing systems are there because they work. Therefore, they're not likely to buy 
into doing things in a new way, unless they're shown in a concrete way why it’s better 
than the established method.</p>

<p>ISFJ’s have a very clear idea of the way things should be, which they strive to attain. 
They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. They tend to believe 
that existing systems are there because they work. Therefore, they're not likely to buy 
into doing things in a new way, unless they're shown in a concrete way why it’s better 
than the established method.</p> 
<p>ISFJ’s learn best by doing, rather than by reading about something in a book, or applying 
theory. For this reason, they are not likely to be found in fields which require a lot of 
conceptual analysis or theory. They value practical application. Traditional methods of 
higher education, which require a lot of theorizing and abstraction, are likely to be a 
chore for the ISFJ. The ISFJ learns a task best by being shown its practical application. 
Once the task is learned, and its practical importance is understood, the ISFJ will 
faithfully and tirelessly carry through the task to completion. The ISFJ is extremely 
dependable.</p> 
<p>The ISFJ has an extremely well-developed sense of space, function, and aesthetic appeal. 
For that reason, they're likely to have beautifully furnished, functional homes. They make 
extremely good interior decorators. This special ability, combined with their sensitivity toother's feelings and desires, makes them very likely to be great gift-givers - finding the 
right gift which will be truly appreciated by the recipient.</p> 
<p>More so than other types, ISFJ’s are extremely aware of their own internal feelings, as 
well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their own feelings, keeping 
things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside the ISFJ until they 
turn into firm judgments against individuals which are difficult to change, once set. Many 
ISFJ’s learn to express themselves, and find outlets for their powerful emotions. 
Just as the ISFJ is not likely to express their feelings, they are also not likely to let on that 
they know how others are feeling. However, they will speak up when they feel another 
individual really needs help, and in such cases they can truly help others become aware of 
their feelings.</p> 
<p>The ISFJ feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty. They take their responsibilities 
very seriously, and can be counted on to follow through. For this reason, people naturally 
tend to rely on them. The ISFJ has a difficult time saying "no" when asked to do 
something, and may become over-burdened. In such cases, the ISFJ does not usually 
express their difficulties to others, because they intensely dislike conflict, and because 
they tend to place other people's needs over their own. The ISFJ needs to learn to 
identify, value, and express their own needs, if they wish to avoid becoming over-worked 
and taken for granted.</p> 
<p>ISFJ’s need positive feedback from others. In the absence of positive feedback, or in the 
face of criticism, the ISFJ gets discouraged, and may even become depressed. When 
down on themselves or under great stress, the ISFJ begins to imagine all of the things that 
might go critically wrong in their life. They have strong feelings of inadequacy, and 
become convinced that "everything is all wrong", or "I can't do anything right".</p> 
<p>The ISFJ is warm, generous, and dependable. They have many special gifts to offer, in 
their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to keep things running smoothly. They 
need to remember to not be overly critical of themselves, and to give themselves some of 
the warmth and love which they freely dispense to others.</p>

       <p>ISFJ’s are the homemakers, caretakers and facilitators of the world. Their strong sense of 
duty, hard-working tendencies and ability to respond quickly to what is suitable to a 
particular situation are great assets. With a dominant function that quickly grasps the 
qualities inherent within the external world, and a secondary function that weighs such 
perceptions against their value within this world, the ISFJ has a great talent for 
discovering the aesthetic and essential qualities compatible with and relevant to a 
particular real world situation. This means that, not only within the world of objects, but 
also in their relationships with people, ISFJ’s are gifted with the ability to recognize and 
understand the comfort and surroundings suitable to a secure and pleasing existence. And 
they can do this with a decisiveness which might make others wonder if the ISFJ was not 
in fact getting their answers from some form of intuitive understanding rather than what 
is really a vast library of carefully related memory images and value judgments. An ISFJ 
will always feel best when their world a place of quality and reassurance, both for 
themselves and others. Success for an ISFJ means being able to fulfill a role providing 
value for others and ordering their world in a way in which safety and security is 
balanced against a genuine respect for the aesthetic and positive qualities of life.</p>

       <p>As an ISFJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural 
strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth 
and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and how you can 
better use your talents to achieve your dreams.</p> 
<p>Nearly all ISFJ’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should 
embrace and nourish these strengths:</p>
<ul> 
<li> You are adept at seeing the right balance, the best way to make the world look 
and feel good. This talent enables you to make your world reflect your inner self 
and become a place of security and growth in which others can feel at ease too.</li>  
<li> You have a gift for knowing what will make another person feel better about the 
world and themselves. Your valuable input to their world comes back to you in 
ways which aid your own personal development. </li> 
<li>You see clearly what is right and wrong, what grates on yourself and others, what 
works for harmony and what does not. Your clear recognition of these things 
gains you the confidence and respect of others. </li> 
<li>You have a great memory for things, places and events, their curious details and 
the relationships between them. More than this, you also remember what was both 
good and bad about these things. These skills show in your ability to give no 
nonsense advice and aid to others</li>  
<li>Within yourself you know, even if others do not realize it, that for as long as they 
are trying to do their best, you will hold the line with them to the very end. You 
see this as simply doing the right thing, but in fact it is a special virtue and makes 
you one of the most worthy of partners and friends when the chips are down. 
You work hard to get the job done, and you can be counted on the stay with it till 
it is finished. </li> 
<p>ISFJ’s who have a strongly expressed Extraverted Feeling function will find they also 
enjoy these very special gifts:</p> 
<li>Work is never a chore to you, but a gift you offer to the world.</li>  
<li>In your relationships you are able to clearly show others how you feel about them. </li> 
<li>Others will always feel at ease in your home and presence. </li> 
<li>Your efforts always seem to be appreciated by those around you. </li> 
<li>You will try to find pleasing ways to settle differences and to find the most 
satisfying solutions to both your own and others difficulties. </li> 
<li>More often than not, you will know exactly the right thing to do, say, buy or 
create to make things better or move things toward a valid human solution to a 
problem </li> 
<li>You will clearly see the conditions underlying a situation and their effects on the 
persons within it, enabling you to see ways of changing things for the better. In 
this sense, you may be a powerful agent for social justice.</li>

     	<p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. The strong expression of any 
function can overshadow others, whilst at the same time its own associated and 
unexpressed inferior function can mine the unconscious mind and throw up annoying 
resistances and unsettling emotions. We value our strengths, but we often curse and - 
even more limiting to our potential development - ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a 
person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, 
but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our 
personality type's potential problem areas.</p> 
<p>ISFJ’s are kind, steady and responsible beings with many special gifts. I would like for 
the ISFJ to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an ISFJ 
as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses 
associated with being an ISFJ are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to 
read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to 
enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy 
and successful lives. </p>
<p>Many of the weaker characteristics that are found in ISFJ’s are due to their dominant and 
Introverted Sensing function overshadowing the rest of their personality. This generally 
results in two notable effects: their Extraverted Feeling function is unable to balance their 
sharply rendered inner perceptions with a sense of human value, whilst at the same time 
these very perceptions often hint at strange associations and consequences which seem 
always to hover darkly in the background of the worldIn such cases, an ISFJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying 
degrees: </p>
<ul>
<li>May find difficulty expressing their feelings without fear or anger.</li>
<li>May be unable to correctly judge what really is for the best </li>
<li>May wrongly suspect others of having hidden motives or agendas </li>
<li>May be unable to shrug off feelings impending disaster </li>
<li>May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their certainty 
about the “correct” or “right” way to do things </li>
<li>May have a tendency to blame particular persons for disturbing or upsetting “their 
world” by simply being who they are </li>
<li>May come across to others as cold and insensitive to anything but another’s 
ability to fit in with and support their own judgments </li>
<li>May be unnecessarily harsh or strict about appropriate social behavior</li> 
<li>May be oblivious to what others think about them </li>
<li>May come across as rigid, inflexible or even cold and uncaring to others, without 
being aware of it </li>
<li>May be unable to understand verbal logic, and quickly cut off other’s 
explanations </li>
<li>May value their own certainties about the world and its problems far above others</li> 
<li>May be quite falsely certain of their influence upon, and understanding of others </li>
<li>May be extremely vulnerable to tricks, con men, false hopes, religious cults and 
conspiracy theories </li>
<li>May react with anger or distress when someone expresses disagreement with their 
view of the world, or disapproval of their judgments </li>
<li>May favor their judgments to the degree that they are unable to notice the pain or 
difficulty such judgments might cause others </li>
<li>Under great stress, are likely to make outrageously harsh and uncaringly selfish 
survival oriented decisions</li>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various 
degrees to the ISFJ’s internally mapped and abstract view of the world not being 
successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Extroverted feeling. Without this rational 
external balance, the ISFJ’s opposing unconscious functions can wreak havoc upon the 
order and sense of the ISFJ’s perceptions and ideas. ISFJ’s are usually stable, certain, 
reliable and deft in their approach to life. But if unbalanced, they are likely to treat any 
point of view other than their own with a kind of cold dismay, and if pressed hard will 
tend to shut out the existence of problems caused by others differing attitudes and 
opinions. If the ISFJ does not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing world 
views they come into contact with, they can find themselves closed into a lonely little 
corner of the world in which only their own feelings of safety and certainty are 
maintained. This is a natural survival technique for the extreme ISFJ personality.The main driver to the ISFJ personality is Introverted Sensing, whose function is to 
define the properties of and locate and recognize the sometimes abstract and innate 
qualities of and between the objects of the outer world. If an ISFJ’s picture of the world 
is threatened by external influences, the ISFJ generally tries to shut such new information 
out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche 
from getting hurt. However, the ISFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly 
will become closed within a small and ever decreasing circle of those family and friends 
who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will 
always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault 
with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for 
them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have a negatively 
polarized and therefore limited ability to communicate outside of the box of their own 
security needs. </p>
<p>It is not an uncommon tendency for the ISFJ to support their ideas and values by using 
only the value judgments they make about the world and other peoples behavior. 
However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ISFJ personality is too self- 
centered to be happy or successful. Since the ISFJ's dominant function is Introverted 
Sensing, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If the 
ISFJ uses Extraverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Introverted Sensing, then the 
ISFJ is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the ISFJ does not sufficiently 
recognize and sympathize with the way feelings affect the behavior of others in the world 
to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own 
perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their 
perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgmental and full of 
fixed and often rather ambiguously polarized ideas about the world. Other people are 
often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how 
they came by them. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
      <p>To grow as an individual, the ISFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include 
a more accurate picture of the feelings and value judgments of others. In order to be in a 
position in which the ISFJ is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their 
internal value system, the ISFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not threatened 
by the new information. The ISFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that emotional 
affects in others are not unrelated to reality; that the feelings of others are also just and 
valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world.</p> 
<p>The ISFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their 
motivation for deciding what is good and bad, right and wrong. Do they try to find the 
feeling values of others in a situation? Or, do they value only those feelings which 
support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is felt, is the ISFJ only 
concerned with whether that feeling supports something they recognize as correct? Or is 
she/he concerned with becoming truly empathetic? To achieve a better understanding of 
others and the world in which they live, the ISFJ should try to put themselves into the 
minds of others, to locate and recognize how they have come to feel the way they do,before making judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard 
anything that doesn't agree with their carefully ordered concepts, and work towards 
lessening this tendency. They should try to feel the way others would feel in situations, 
without making personal judgments about the actual situations. In general, they should 
work on exercising their Feeling in a truly extraverted sense. In other words, they should 
use Feeling to locate the their true connections to and relationship with others for the sake 
of gaining a wider perspective, rather than only allowing such feeling values to support 
their own conclusions. The ISFJ who successfully feels things objectively may be quite a 
powerful force for positive change.</p>

     <p>Some ISFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of 
an inability to flow with what is, a too negative or correcting attitude which dismays 
others, or unrealistic ideals and ideas about the world. These issues mostly stem from 
using Extraverted Feeling in a diminished manner: the lack of a strong externally focused 
value system allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended world view which 
has little relation to concrete reality to control the personality. An ISFJ who attempts to 
feel and value the feelings of others for the sake of understanding the world around them, 
rather than quickly deciding how they and they alone feel, will have a clearer, more 
objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon structure and correct 
behavior, but also how human values make it just what it is and not something else 
perhaps more desirable. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to 
demand that the world and the behavior of others conform to some abstract code of being. 
Such well-adjusted ISFJ’s will fit happily into our society. Unless you really understand 
Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a difficult 
task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an unambiguous and totally extraverted direction. 
It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive 
into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help 
you to begin exercising your Extraverted Feeling more fully: </p>
<p>Take care to try and discover why others feel the way they do. Try to notice the 
connections between their feelings and the way they see the world. Don’t immediately 
compare your own value judgments about the world to theirs; simply accept that for them 
this is a real and perfectly valid way of responding. </p>
<p>Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or 
disregarded by others. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the 
situation. Don't try to assume they would judge as you do: "she would have to feel the 
same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his tune if he saw things from 
my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the situation. 
Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken seriously or 
lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to 
your own.</p> 
<p>When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time 
to finding out how the other person feels about what they are describing. Concentrate onreally sensing their emotional state. Tell them how you feel and compare. Ask questions 
about why they feel as they do.</p> 
<p>Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself 
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life 
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. 
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is feeling right now. 
What emotions are they enacting, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or 
compare their situation to your own.</p> 
<p>Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any 
length of time.</p>

<li>Feed Your Strengths! Let your talent for recognizing harmony and balance spill 
out into the world around you, show your gifts to the world. Allow yourself to 
take opportunities to design, reorganize and rebalance things to make your home 
and work environments better for yourself and others. Find work or a hobby 
which allows you to realize these strengths. </li>
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some things are never going to 
be how you would like them to be. Understand that other peoples feelings are 
sometimes more important than whether they are right or wrong. Facing and 
dealing with discord or differences in others doesn't mean that you have to 
change who you are; it means that you are giving yourself opportunities to grow. 
By facing your weaknesses, you honor your true self and that of others. </li>
<li>Discover the World of Others. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you 
always know what is right for others. Open your heart to the possibility of 
understanding that their true needs are something that must be discovered 
through relationship, and recognition that their world might be very different, yet 
just as valid as your own. </li>
<li>Don’t be too hasty. Try to let things settle before you make a judgment, allowing 
others to discover the best for themselves while you feel your way into their way 
of seeing things. </li>
<li>Look Carefully at the World. Remember, things are not always what they seem 
on the surface. You might need to look deeper to discover the truth, particularly 
when it seems you are sure of your first quick judgment. There are layers of 
meaning and truth beneath everything. </li>
<li>Try to Let Others Take Some of the Load. By letting others help, you are not 
letting things get out of control, but are validating their own need to be a part of 
your life. Remember, it is better to guide another to see your point of view than 
keeping them out of the picture. </li>
<li>Be Accountable to Others. Remember that they need to understand you and your 
needs too. Express your feelings and reasons and let them become partners to 
your goals. </li>
<li>Don’t Hem Yourself in. Staying in your comfort zone is self defeating in the 
end. Try to make every day one where you get out and discover a littlesomething different about the world and others. This will broaden your horizons 
and bring new ideas and opportunities into focus. </li>
<li>Assume the Best and Seek for it. Don't wait for others to live up to your 
expectations. Every person has a goldmine of worth in them, just as every 
situation can be turned to some good. If you let yourself believe this, you will 
find yourself discovering ways to make it true for you.</li> 
<li>When in Doubt, Ask For Help! Don't let your sense of self sufficiency leave you 
on the horns of a dilemma or lead you into disaster. If you are uncertain of 
something or someone then get input from others you trust.</li>
